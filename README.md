## About

Day four of the MNML Series One (minimal series one) week saw the introduction of 33.333rpm, the speed at which as 12" album vinyl is played.

This carried on the formula of converting a bpm into a groove size, but each album has a random number of tracks on it. With each track having it's own bpm the album has it's own unique spiral pattern.

The slightly offset printed label takes it's colours from those used in A Slight Case of Overbombing.
